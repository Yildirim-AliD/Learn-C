# My C Programming Notes

This is where I keep the things I learn in C, with example codes.  
Each folder contains a different topic — sometimes simple, sometimes more advanced stuff.  
I use this repo to track my learning progress and to revisit topics later.

Some topics covered:
- Basic syntax and data types
- Conditionals and loops
- Functions (normal, recursive)
- Pointers
- File operations
- Advanced: variadic functions, command-line arguments, setjmp/longjmp, inline assembly, signal handling
